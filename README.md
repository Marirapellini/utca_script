# utca_scripts

This script was used during my internship in order to study the behaviour of the detector bcm1f (bril team-cms experience at CERN); the change in temperatures could affect the values of reference for the detector here analyzed (baseline, amplitude) therefore the necessity to verify that the detector does not behave differently then what expected when there are changes in the environment surrounding it. 
A first study just concerned half of the channels available at bcm1f, later all channels were introduced.
